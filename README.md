# Express-React-Router-Redux-Server-example
Express example app with React, react-router, Redux, server rendering

This is an ```Express``` app using react, redux, react-router, Es6, and server rendering.

## Installation

First make sure you have installed ```Nodejs```(5.0+), then clone this repo and ```cd``` to the project directory and run ```npm install```.

## Run
  Run ```npm start``` from the project root directory to compile and start the server.

## Develop
1. Open another session in terminal, and use the command below to start express server with ```nodemon``` and:

      Run ```npm run dev1``` or ```npm run dev-server``` from the project root directory.
      This will load your server on http://localhost:3000

2. Use ```nodemon``` and ```webpack``` and ```Browsersync``` to pack the client js:

      Run ```npm run dev2``` or ```npm run dev-webpack``` from the project root directory.
      Browsersync will load your server on http://localhost:3100
      but you can see the non reloading server on http://localhost:3000
